I am a Ph.D. student working at the intersection of Building Information Modeling (BIM), 3D point cloud understanding, and Engineering Informatics. My research focuses on applying computational methods to analyze and improve the quality, semantics, and geometry of engineering data. My current interests include:

- Semantic diagnosis for BIM–IFC category mapping errors, with an emphasis on structural patterns and automated correction.
- Parameter-free and geometry-aware encoders for 3D point clouds, such as Gaussian, Laplace, Spherical and GPE-based positional embeddings.
- Multi-view and point-cloud fusion frameworks involving CNNs, BI-GRUs, and generative models for shape reconstruction and classification.
- Topological Data Analysis (TDA) for capturing fine-grained geometric and structural properties in 3D objects.

I aim to develop robust, interpretable, and reproducible computational tools that bridge the gap between AI and practical engineering workflows.
